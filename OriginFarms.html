  <h3>About</h3>

    <br><br>Lucie Kulze founded the farm in 2015 and seeks to renew the rice plantation that was once there.<br>
    The farm's vision is to connect the community to locally grown, seasonal produce beyond the rice crop.<br>
    Today, you can find Origin Farm's rice in the downtown Charleston's local farmers market. Look out for it!
