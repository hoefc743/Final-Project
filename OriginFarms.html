  <h2>About the Farm</h2>

  <br>

  <p>Origin Farms is a rice plantation on Plum Hill Plantation in South Carolina.<br>
    Lucie Kulze founded the farm in 2015 and seeks to renew the rice plantation that was once there.<br>
    The farm's vision is to connect the community to locally grown, seasonal produce beyond the rice crop.<br>
    Today, you can find Origin Farm's rice in the downtown Charleston's local farmers market. Look out for it!
