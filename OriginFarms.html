    <br><br>Lucie Kulze founded the farm in 2015 and seeks to renew the rice plantation that was once there.<br>
    The farm's vision is to connect the community to locally grown, seasonal produce even beyond the rice crop.<br>
    Today, you can find Origin Farm's rice in the downtown Charleston's local farmers market. Look out for it!<br><br>

    Carolina Gold Rice is both a traditional and heirloom crop.<br>
    Rice cultivation was born in the United States in Charleston, SC<br>
    around 1685. On Plum Hill Plantation, the rice is grown and<br>
    harvested in historic paddy fields.

    severe milling and polishing process, it is devoid of practically all vitamins and nutrients."
